# web-passwgen
A Password Generator Website that provides a weak, recommended, strong and easy to read password.

It is a random password generator so it is usually gibberish.
There is a seperate JS file that handles all of the random password generation.

If you do use the this code, please take certain sections of code and do not use the whole entire code. Thank you.
